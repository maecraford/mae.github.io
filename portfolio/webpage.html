	During my Sophmore year at Parsons I took a class about coding. We created many different simple webpages exploring the tools and ideas that can be manifested through code.

	<br>
	I Don't Know was created based on the idea of bouncing objects. I had trouble coming up with the idea for this piece in terms of what I wanted it to say. I am very indecisive. To fix my creative block I asked two of my friends what I should create my piece around. One said shrimp and the other said chicken. The first thing that came to mind was a top ramen package. The rest is best shown and not described.

	The Range was created using the breakpoint function. Cowboy culture has a large influence on pop culture these days. I decided to create a page based on the idea that "every cowboy has there own range". Once on the page reshape it to be skinnier and see the cowboys range change.

	The Magician is based on a simple button function. Simple and perfect, by clicking on the magicians hat a magical surpirse will appear. Keep clicking to see the magic continue.

	To Build or Not To Build is a text adventure which enables you to build a simple poem. By clicking through the pages you will begin to accumulate lines. Want to rewrite it? Start back from the beginning.

	The Clock is nothing but a clock. However this clock is made up by three blinking lines. One blinks every second, one every minute, one every hour. The lines are connected to a real time clock.
