This series of images and text were created as part of a class project for Advanced Typography during my Sophmore year at Parsons. I have always been fascinated by mythology and the monsters that fill them. For this project we were tasked with finding stories or articles that interested us and create a layout that complimented them. I chose to create a series of mythological monsters.

<br>
This particular design was actually very fun to create. I wanted the images to have a childrens book feel. I got the idea of creating images out of type from another typography class I had taken during Freshman year. I spent a lot of time figuring out which letter forms would best work for each monster. I created the whole piece using InDesign.
