	Cultured Stickers was a company founded the summer of 2016. When I met Molly Wu at MICA Pre-College we instantly connected over our shared love of coffee and stickers. By the time Pre-College had ended we not only had an amazing friendship but also the start to a pretty great company. Over the course of the next two years we put out a total of around 60 different stickers. All of the designs were created by the two of us and also manfuactured by us. We sold them through Etsy and found a great following of people who loved stickers just as much as we do. We got orders from around the world and we got orders of all different sizes.

		When the time for college came Molly and I decided to scale back the company to only sell a selection of ten stickers. While we were still recieving orders it became secondary to our school work. By the time sophmore year started, neither Molly or I had the time or space to continue creating and selling the stickers. We chose to close up shop in October of 2018, two years after we began.

		While Molly and I still enojy stickers and the freedom to create and sell our own work a hiatus was the best thing for us at the time. Hopefully some day in the future we will be able to re open shop and add further to the world of stickers.
