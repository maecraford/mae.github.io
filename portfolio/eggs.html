This design piece was created as part of a collection of egg related articles. While most of the articles were written about chicken eggs, I decided to choose an article written about salmon roe. The article I chose was one written about salmon milking. I chose it because it was on an interesting topic and it was also a shorter article which allowed for me to play with the space I had more.

This particular design went throught many different changes to end up where it is now. Once I had the overall layout put together it was all about the details. I went through multiple typefaces and colors till I found one that worked. It was also about finding the right way for all my text boxes to work together. I also spent time on the detailing for the fish.
