	During my Sophmore year at Parsons I was assigned a project in which we were instructed to create a booklet with three perameters.
	<br> 
	<br>
	 1. It has to include an interview with another classmate 
	 <br>
	 2. It has to include a recipe 
	 <br>
	 3. It has to include a horoscope
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 I struggled for some time with the formot of this book. I did many hands on collage iterations in order to figure out exaclty what I wanted. In the end I created a minimalist coloring book inspired booklet. In the interview with my classmate Asa I wanted to focus on certain questions that I ask in order to get to the "essence" of a person in my mind. The pesto recipe represents home to me, its an old recipe that I have been making my whole life. Instead of a horoscope I decided to add a fortune cookie to the cover. The title of the booklet, Cognitive, is one of my favorite words to me it brings to mind the necessity to constantly be thinkging and learning from the world around you.

	 The first verion of the booklet that I produced was printed out in outline in black and white. I then colored it in with colored pencil and scanned it in. I printed the final copy on thick white paper.
