	During my Sophmore year at Parsons I was assigned a project in which we were instructed to create a website built around a piece of found diologue.
	<br>
	<br> 
	The piece I decided to create was based around the opening scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. In the scene King Arthur debates with a soldier about the migration of coconuts. The piece is simple and hilarious. When creating the website we had certain perameter. We had to use only a singluar typeface and we could only use text to emphasise the dictation and emotions in the scene.

	<br>
	Here is the video of the scene:
