During my frehsman year at Parsons I was asked to create a zine on any topic that interested me. I decided to create a piece about me and my friends at the time. I found it interesting the relationhsip between people in terms of how they view eachother. I asked my friends to each write a reference letter for me as if I was applying for a job somewhere. I did not tell them that the letter was for an art project but rather that it was for a job I was interviewing for. Then I drew a picture of each of them and juxtaposed the image and the text they sent to me on a spread in the zine.

<br>
Some of my friends knew the actual prompt and took the "assignment" of creating a refernce letter as more of a joke and their letters are a bit less proffesional than others. I didn't read or edit any of the letters before putting them on the page. They were all typeset by their creators. The final product was printed and a copy was given to each of the participants.
