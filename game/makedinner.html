MAKE DINNER
<br>
<br>
Your art student and their roommates have found the best grocery store to get all the goodies they will need to sruvive.
<br>
<br>
Having a kitchen is saving your art student money and reminding them of the joys of cooking.
<br>
<br>
It is even inspiring them to make better eating and exercising habits.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
How should they keep up this motivation?
