GO OUT!
<br>
<br>

Your art student
 really loves the party life. 
While they have made some friends, these friends arenâ€™t having the best influence. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

Partying all the time has them skipping out on work and class. 
<br>

However, they are having a lot of fun. 

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Should they pull 
back on the 
partying and get back to focus on school work. Or should they keep doing what 
they love?
