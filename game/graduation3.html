GRADUATION
<br>
<br>
<br>
CONGRATS on finally recieving a BFA!!!
<br>
<br>
Your art student is beyond excited to be done with the wild ride that was art school.
<br>
<br>
They are a bit burnt out from all the focus of the past year and have decided to head back to their home town for some comfort.
<br>
<br>
Who knows where this degree will take them.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
They thank you for guiding them through the maze of art school.
