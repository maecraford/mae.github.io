KEEP PARTYING
<br>
<br>
Your art student has continued to party. 
Their grades are 
dipping. Their dream of getting a BFA is dwindling. 
<br>
<br>
Are they just 
going to become 
another failed 
art student? 
<br>
<br>
Your art students parents are pulling them out of school if they donâ€™t get their grades up. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Give up and drop out, or stop partying and focus on school?
