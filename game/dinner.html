			DINNER
<br>
<br>
Your art student forgot how delicious the big city can be.
<br>
<br>
The night was filled with good food and even better friends.
<br>
<br>
Not only did you catch up on the summers fun, but you also talked about the year to come.

First week is underway, should they focus more on readings for lecture or sketches for class?
